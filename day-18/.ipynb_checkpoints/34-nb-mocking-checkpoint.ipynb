    "Key Points About Mocking:\n",
    "Isolation: Mocking helps isolate the unit of code being tested, ensuring that tests are not affected by external dependencies.\n",
    "Control: You can control the behavior of mock objects, specifying return values, exceptions, and interactions.\n",
    "Verification: Mocking allows you to verify that certain methods were called with expected parameters, ensuring correct interactions.\n",
    "Efficiency: Mock objects are typically faster and more efficient than real objects, making tests run quicker."
