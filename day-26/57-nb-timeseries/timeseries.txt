What is a Time Series?

📌 Definition:

A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time, 
typically at uniform intervals.

🔍 Key Examples:

    📈 Stock Prices (daily/hourly)
    🌦️ Temperature records (hourly/daily)
    🏭 Sensor readings (per second)
    🏥 Patient vitals (minute-wise)
    📊 Web traffic or sales data (daily/weekly)

🧠 Why is Time Important?

    Data is chronologically ordered
    Order matters — previous values can affect future ones
    Allows us to model trends, seasonality, and patterns

Components of a Time Series

📉 Components:

    Trend: Long-term movement over time (upward/downward)
    Seasonality: Repeating short-term cycle (daily, monthly, yearly)
    Cyclic: Fluctuations without fixed frequency (e.g. economy)
    Noise: Irregular, random variation

✅ Applications:

    📊 Forecasting (sales, demand, energy use)
    📉 Anomaly Detection (fraud, machine failure)
    🧠 Insights from patterns over time
    📅 Time-dependent modeling (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
