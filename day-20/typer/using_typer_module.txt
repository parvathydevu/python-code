Typer is a modern Python library for building command-line interface (CLI) applications. Itâ€™s built on top of Click, and it's inspired by FastAPI, so it uses type hints and declarative syntax to create powerful CLIs with minimal code.

Why Use Typer?

    Auto-generation of help and CLI docs
    Type safety with autocomplete (especially when used in tools like zsh or IDEs)
    Built-in support for options, arguments, and commands
    Very intuitive for Python developers, especially if you're familiar with FastAPI

Installation:

    pip install typer

Usage:
