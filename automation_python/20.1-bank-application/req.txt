Problem Statement: Bank Account Management App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are tasked with developing a command-line Bank Account Management Application in Python. 
The app should allow users to perform basic banking operations such as:

    Creating new user accounts
    Updating account details
    Viewing account details
    Depositing and withdrawing money
    Deleting accounts

Each user will have:

    Unique account number (auto-generated)
    Name
    Email
    Balance
    Account type (savings/current)

Data should be stored in a JSON file so that changes persist across sessions.

Add a PIN-based authentication system:

    User creates an account with a PIN
    User must authenticate with correct PIN for actions like deposit, withdraw, update
    PINs are securely stored (we’ll use password hashing)
    Optional PIN retry limit or error handling



🧠 Other optional ideas:

✅ Save data to JSON/SQLite for persistence
✅ Limit incorrect PIN attempts
✅ Export/import accounts
✅ Add transaction history
